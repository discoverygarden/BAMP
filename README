## BAMP Drupal Project

This project consists of a set of DRUPAL modules that facilitate the ingest of CSV data into a set of database tables and then exposes that data via drupal views module. 


## Current Modules

- CSVUpload: Allows upload of CSV file, mapping of file to database columns, upload of data to temporary table, review of uploaded data and committ to final production tables.
- iReport: This currently just displays a list of reports created within the views UI
